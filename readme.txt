Basic intro to this project can be found on my blog: http://www.adathedev.co.uk/2013/02/import-twitter-archive-elasticsearch.html

ElasticTweets - very basic WinForms GUI (and I mean basic, no basic input validation etc) allowing you to import the tweet data into ElasticSearch
ElasticTweets.Library - all the engine room nuts and bolts 
ElasticTweets.Library.UnitTests - does what it says on the tin...unit tests
