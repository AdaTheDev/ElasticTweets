Basic intro to this project can be found on my blog: http://www.adathedev.co.uk/2013/02/import-twitter-archive-elasticsearch.html

ElasticTweets - basic WinForms GUI allowing you to import the tweet data into ElasticSearch
ElasticTweets.Library - all the engine room nuts and bolts 
ElasticTweets.Library.UnitTests - does what it says on the tin...unit tests

Purpose of this project:
* to provide a way to import your Twitter archive into ElasticSearch
* starter project for getting to know ElasticSearch, how to interact with via .NET and the client libraries available (currently
using NEST)
* providing real examples of the types of ElasticSearch queries you can perform
